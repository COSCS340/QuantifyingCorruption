# Quantifying Corruption

## Getting Started
You can clone this repo with the following command `git clone https://github.com/COSCS340/QuantifyingCorruption`  
This project uses Python3; if you don't already have it installed you can get installation help here `https://www.python.org/`  
Once you have this repo and python3 you can install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt` (we recommend using a virtual environment... but that's on you)  
To run the project locally navigate into the qc directory (`cd qc`) and run `python manage.py runserver`. You can then see the app run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
