## Introduction
The United States spent 3.15 billion dollars on lobbying in 2016. The trend of lobbying in the United States
has only risen over the years. Lobbying is intended to give the stakeholders of certain policies a direct method
of communicating with their representatives. The failing of this system is that it gives disproportionate amount
of influence to those with more financial resources. This creates an undesirable scenario where those with more
economic resources will pursue goals that reinforce their control over those resources, without regard for the
well-being of others. Previously this issue has been explored statistically, but in order to truly be made operational it must be presented in an format that is both accessible and easily understood.  
We plan to create a free web app to allow the average citizen to check how their representatives are behaving. The lack of clear monetization strategies has discouraged market forces from producing a similar offering, so ours will be the first of its kind.

## Technology
### Heroku
We'll use a heroku hobby dyno to host any apps or services we may make; this will allow us to not worry to much about our server environment while also keeping costs low.
### SQLite/Postgres
Per our use of heroku we'll use relational SQL databases to store all production data. This may be on a SQLite database during development, or a Heroku Postgres database in production.
### Python 3.X
We'll use python as our serverside language and we'll use the most current stable version of it, which at time of writing is python 3.6. Most versions of Python 3 should work, but 3.6 is the standard.
### Django
Django enforces good practices and it's "batteries included" approach will allow us work only on the parts of our app that are important and novel.
### Bootstrap
We'll use bootstrap 3 for basic styling upon which we'll put our own styling.
### Other stuff
We'll try to keep things simple and only use tools when they're needed. We'll use whitenoise for serving static files, javascript and jquery where necessary, and things like photoshop if the need arises. We will not use any front end frameworks, "compile to css" languages, or anything else that makes our tech stack more cluttered.
